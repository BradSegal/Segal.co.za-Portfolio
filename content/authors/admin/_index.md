Iï»¿'m Brad, a practicing medical doctor with a passion for technology and innovation. I simultaneously pursued medicine along with a master's degree in biomedical engineering focusing on the applications of machine learning for health. Iï»¿ have worked extensively at the intersection of healthcare and data science to develop solutions to the challenges found in low-resource health systems, often serving as a bridge between technical and clinical teams. Iï»¿'m fascinated by the future of medical practice and how artificial intelligence will shape and enhance it.
